# considers contacts between atom listed in $type2rad
# that are more than four residue positions in protein sequence apart
# Pairwise residue interactions are calculated according to the residue
# contact defined previously (22) (i.e. if the distance between any two heavy
# atoms from two residues is smaller than the sum of their van der Waals
# radii plus 0.6 Angstrom, these two residues are considered “in contact”).
# However, we exclude from this calculation contact pairs that are within 4
# residues in sequence, because the van der Waals interactions between a
# residue and its immediate neighbors are not sensitive
# to conformational rearrangements.
