PySFD Features - Significant Feature Differences Analyzer for Python
=======================================

Special Note:
This package uses the pandas module, whose std() function applied
on an array-like of length N uses \sqrt(N - 1) and not
\sqrt(N) - as in numpy - as the denominator.
Therefore, all manual standard deviation implementations in PySFD
consistently use \sqrt(N - 1).
